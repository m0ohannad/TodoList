## Project Description

<!-- - This project is a simple todo list that allows the user to add, delete, mark tasks as completed and store them in the browser's local storage. -->

- This project is a web application that implements a todo list functionality using the CRUD concept. The user can create new tasks, read the existing tasks, update the task status, and delete the tasks as needed. The tasks are stored in the local storage of the browser, so they are persistent across sessions. Also, the web interface is responsive and can adjust to various screen dimensions and devices.
